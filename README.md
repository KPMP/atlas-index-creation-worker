# Atlas Index Creation Worker

The Atlas Index Creation Worker queries the data in the Staging Database and generates and submits the index updates to the Atlas File Repositoryâ€™s Elasticsearch index. There are three endpoints for the Worker:

Regenerate the entire ES index:
http://localhost:5001/api/v1/index/file_cases

Update a single file:
http://localhost:5001/api/v1/index/file_cases/file_id/<file uuid>

Regenerate a given release:
http://localhost:5001/api/v1/index/file_cases/release_ver/<release version>


## Useful ES calls
This is a small subset of the entire API available for use. You may execute these restful quries as curl commands or through the kibana dev-tools panel. The following examples will assume the dev-tool panel is being used.
  
### Show List of Index
`GET _cat/indices/%2A?v=`

  ### Get the total number of documents within a specific index (file_cases)
`GET file_cases/_count`

 ### Show the type mapping for an index (file_cases)
`GET file_cases/_mapping/?include_type_name=true`

### Show the type mapping for a specific field (file_size) within an index (file_cases)
`GET /file_cases/_mapping/field/file_size?pretty`

  ### Examine the data of a single document within a specific instance
`GET file_cases/_doc/0043e10d-1f57-47be-a8c8-f97537efced8`
 
  
### Create a new Index,
```
PUT /file_cases?pretty
{
    "settings" : {
        "number_of_shards" : 1
    },
   "mappings": { 
     "properties": { 
		   "file_name": { "type": "keyword" },
       ...}
  }
}
```

### Transfer data from one index to another
```
  POST _reindex 
  {
    "source": {
         "index": "file_cases"
     },
     "dest": {
         "index": "file_cases_v2"
     }
}
```
  
### Delete an index
`DELETE file_cases`


## How to update the index

Elastic search does not allow an index to be updated, this presents a challenge when the underlying model requires an update. For example, the transformation of a field from one type to another. The following is an example on how to update a field, field_size, from type keyword to type long.

0. Before starting this process, ensure you have up-to-date backups in case something goes wrong.
  
1. Modify the existing index mapping
  `"file_name": { "type": "keyword" } =>  "file_name": { "type": "long" }`
  
2. Create a new index using the updated mapping, note this must be a unique name. For our example, we are adding _temp to the name so that file_cases becauses file_cases_temp.
  
  ```
  PUT /file_cases_temp?pretty
  < mapping_json_here >
  ````
    
3. Transfer the data from the current index into the newly created index
```
    POST _reindex 
  {
    "source": {
         "index": "file_cases"
     },
     "dest": {
         "index": "file_cases_temp"
     }
}
```

4. Delete your current index   
`DELETE file_cases`

5. Reindex your newly created index to the name of your initial index.   
```
POST _reindex 
  {
    "source": {
         "index": "file_cases_temp"
     },
     "dest": {
         "index": "file_cases"
     }
}
```

6. Delete your temporary index    
`DELETE file_cases_v2`
 

7. You may need to update other services, such as arranger. To do so, start by tunneling to the knowledge environment with ports 8080.
`ssh -L 8080:localhost:8080 ssh atlas-ke`
    
8. Turn on the arranger-ui
`cd heavens-docker/atlas/knowledge-environment/ && docker-compose -f docker-compose.arranger_ui.yml up -d`
    
9. In your browser, navigate to localhost:8080.

10. Choose the project you're working on and make any required edits. In our example, we need to choose `endpoint` -> `File` -> and then update the DOI field to use `isArray`
    
11. We must create a temporary project to swap it with our current project, much in the same way we needed to do with the index itself. Arranger has some quirks, as such it is best to name your temporary project with something like `123temp`
    
12. Delete your current project
    
13. Save your temporary project, creating a new project in process, with the name of your initial project.
    
14. Delete your temporary project.
  
15. We now neeed to restart the knowledge-environment to see the changes
`docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml down && docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d`
